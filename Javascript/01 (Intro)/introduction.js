// What is JS?
// JS is the programming language for the web.
// No link with Java language.

// --------------------------------------------------

// Why we need JS?
// I need to make a calculator app, so I can't make that with HTML and CSS. HTML gives the structure, CSS is used to design the website, but how can i apply arithmetic operations?
// JS is used for mathematical purpose in websites.
// JS is used to manipulate HTML.
// Eg - If hi is the title of you webpage, then how can you change the title without doing anything in HTML?

// History of JS
// In 1995, Netscape was very popular but websites did not have JS, they only have HTML and CSS.
// Founder of Netscape, Marc Andresson decided to make a programming language for the web. Brendan Eich made JS in 10 days.
// JavaScript was first named Mocha, then LiveScript then JavaScript name was given.
// Netscape & Microsoft were two competitors. 
// Netscape made their services paid which resulted in their downfall, but they inherently used JavaScript language. 
// Microsoft made their services free, but it was based on JScript which resulted in significant popularity.
// Netscape went to ECMA to standardized JavaScript and decided to make their code open source.
// Mozilla took their code --> Updated It --> Launched Mozilla Firefox in 2004.
// In 2008, Google Chrome released V8 Engine.
// V8 Engine was based on JIT Compiler (Just In Time) which used to compile and interpret JavaScript code. It was Super fast and hence became very popular.
// Seeing the popularity of Google, Mozilla also changed their engine to SpiderMonkey.
// Ryan Dahl took V8 Engine and some of its features and then made JavaScript available to run on other than browsers (such as VSCode etc) and hence it was known as Node.js.
