console.log("Hello Coder Army"); // Hello Coder Army is printed.

let ar = "Shriyash" // I have declared a variable ar which contains Shriyash.
ar = "Rohit" // Now, Rohit will be in ar, and Shriyash that was present in ar before would be deleted.
console.log(ar) // Rohit is printed.

const ids = 20; // const --> Value can't be changed. So, ids = 20 means ids will have 20 only.
console.log(ids); // 20 is printed.

var x = 10;
console.log(x); // Answer would be 10 only but don't use it, you will understand the reasons later.
